# package-buildspec-api
 LabVIEW API to modify a Package buildspec (e.g. modify the package version of Dependency packages).
 
 The source code is saved in LabVIEW 2018.

## Support
This API is not officially supported by National Instruments. You can use this GitHub repository to find the source code, report issues, and contribute.

Note: This API programmatically modifies the XML of the LabVIEW project (.lvproj) file to accomplish its functionality, so there is no guarantee that this API will continue to work in later versions of LabVIEW if the .lvproj XML format changes.
